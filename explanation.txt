===  How I Structured the Code  ===
 
1.Defined a class MobiusStrip to encapsulate all logic and ensure modularity.

2.Used the constructor __init__ to accept radius R, width w, and resolution n.

3.Created a private _generate_mesh method to compute the 3D parametric mesh.

4.Separated surface area and edge length logic into distinct, reusable methods.

5.Included a plot() method using matplotlib to visualize the Möbius strip.

6.Added a __main__ block to initialize the class and execute all functions cleanly.



===  How I Approximated Surface Area ===
 
1.Computed partial derivatives of the surface with respect to u and v using numpy.gradient.

2.Calculated the cross product of these partials to get local surface normal vectors.

3.Took the magnitude of the cross product to obtain the surface area element dA.

4.Applied scipy.integrate.simpson to integrate dA over the u-v grid.

5.Ensured correct resolution and mesh symmetry for better integration accuracy.

6.The double integration approximates the continuous surface area numerically.



===  Challenges I Faced  ===
                      
1.The deprecated simps function caused an import error — replaced with simpson.

2.Balancing performance vs. accuracy when increasing mesh resolution (n).

3.Ensuring correct vector math for cross product calculations across the grid.

4.Visualizing the Möbius twist properly required careful grid alignment.

5.Edge length calculation had to be adjusted for numerical stability over a looped path.

6.Debugging integration boundaries and ensuring the correct orientation of derivatives.
